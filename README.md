# meric.xyz

Welcome!

This repository is and probably will stay private. If you see this, congrats:

a) You have unauthorized access to my account.

b) You tricked me.

Either way there is nothing special on this repository. It's just a Firebase project,
since Firebase is not really known for their version management system I had to use
git. I'm not that good at JS so I programmed two sites. This is the desktop version
of meric.xyz

Make yourself comfortable! Especially if your name is Meri√ß!
