# meric.xyz

My personal website, this repo is for people who want to scrape my website without hassle. Things to consider/know:

  - This site is **hosted on a free Firebase plan**; don't expect speed increase as I develop this site.
  - It sadly uses the **_evil_ Cloudflare MITM** (some defend it's no MITM but that's not what we focus on here).
  - Not everything is responsive on this website, so back in the days I thought why not creating two websites that look identical: one [optimized for Desktops](https://meric.xyz) and [one for Mobile](https://https://m.meric.xyz) (I wouldn't do this now, maybe I'll change that later).
  - For Mobile/Desktop detection and website routing I'm using Cloudflare, they have an option to route mobile users to different subdomains.
  - The contact form on th last (4th) page is using Firebase Firestore, I have to admit that it has no Spam protection yet... _(Coming soon)_
  - Why would anyone be interested in my website and even follow this repo and its changes?
  
  
Let's assume for a second you really do care about my personal site and want to report bugs and suggest things, great! Things you can do:

  - Create an Issue _(recommended)_
  - Don't report it and use your knowledge to abuse the site _(generally not something I recommend)_
  - Send me an E-Mail using the address on my website, using PGP should be considered for privacy.
