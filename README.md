# meric.pro

My personal website, this repo is for people who want to scrape my website without hassle. Things to consider/know:

  - This site is **hosted on a free Firebase plan**.
  - Not everything is responsive on this website, so back in the days I thought why not creating two websites that look identical: one [optimized for Desktops](https://meric.pro) and [one for Mobile](https://m.meric.pro) (I wouldn't do this now, maybe I'll change that later).
  - ~~For Mobile/Desktop detection and website routing I'm using Cloudflare, they have an option to route mobile users to different subdomains.~~
  - The contact form on th last (4th) page is using Firebase Firestore, I have to admit that it has no Spam protection yet... _(Coming soon)_
  
  
Let's assume for a second you really do care about my personal site and want to report bugs and suggest things, great! Things you can do:

  - Create an Issue _(recommended)_
  - Don't report it and use your knowledge to abuse the site _(generally not something I recommend)_
  - Send me an E-Mail using the address on my website, and please use PGP/GPG.
